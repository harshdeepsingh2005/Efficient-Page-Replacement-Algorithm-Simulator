# Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator

![Project Banner](./github-header-image.png)

## Overview

**Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator** is a project focused on designing a simulator that enables users to experiment with various page replacement algorithms. The primary goal is to provide insights into how these algorithms manage memory in operating systems. The simulator aims to help students, researchers, and developers understand the strengths and limitations of different algorithms by visualizing their operations and analyzing performance metrics.

## Features

### Algorithm Simulation

- Implement algorithms like:
  - **FIFO (First In, First Out):** Pages are replaced in the order they were added.
  - **LRU (Least Recently Used):** Pages that haven't been used for the longest time are replaced.
  - **Optimal Page Replacement:** Replaces the page that will not be used for the longest time in the future.
- Allow users to input:
  - Sequence of page references.
  - Number of page frames.

### Visualization

- Real-time display of the state of the page frames as the algorithm progresses.
- Highlight page faults visually (e.g., using colors or animations).
- Provide an interactive interface for users to step through the simulation manually or run it automatically.

### Performance Metrics

- Calculate and display statistics such as:
  - Total number of page faults.
  - Total number of hits.
  - Hit ratio (percentage of hits vs. total requests).
- Compare the performance of multiple algorithms side by side.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.7 or higher installed.
- `pip` package manager installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/page-replacement-simulator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd page-replacement-simulator
   ```


## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Run the simulator:
   ```bash
   python simulator.py
   ```
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the page reference sequence and number of frames.

### Example Input and Output

#### Input:
- Page Reference Sequence: `7, 0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2, 3, 0, 3, 2, 1, 2, 0, 1, 7, 0, 1`
- Number of Frames: `3`

#### Output:
- Algorithm: **FIFO**
- Total Page Faults: `12`
- Total Hits: `8`
- Hit Ratio: `40%`
- Visualized Page Table:
  ```
Frame 1: 7  -> 0  -> 1 ...
Frame 2: -  -> 7  -> 0 ...
Frame 3: -  -> -  -> 7 ...
  ```
