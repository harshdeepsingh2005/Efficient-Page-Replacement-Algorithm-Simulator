_***Project Overview**_
This project involves designing a simulator that allows users to experiment with various page replacement algorithms. The focus is on understanding how these algorithms manage memory in operating systems.


_**Expected Outcomes:**_
A functional simulator that visualizes how page replacement algorithms work.
Performance metrics (e.g., hit ratio, fault rate) for comparing different algorithms.


_**Key Features:**_
  --->Algorithm Simulation:
  
        Implement algorithms like FIFO (First In, First Out), LRU (Least Recently Used), and Optimal Page Replacement.
        Users should be able to input the sequence of page references and the number of page frames.
        
  --->Visualization:
  
        Real-time display of the state of the page frames as the algorithm progresses.
        Highlight page faults visually (e.g., using colors or animations).
        
  --->Performance Metrics:
  
        Calculate and display statistics such as the total number of page faults and hit ratio for each algorithm.

_**Programming Languages:**_ :  Python
